    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Finally visited Hogwarts and Diagon Alley and brought wand for myself.</p>

<p>As a loyal Harry Potter Serise fan, I gotta say Orlando trip was amazing. Well done Universal Studio.</p>

<p>Now, got back to deal with Hadoop stuff.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Booked our trip to Orlando the coming July 4th. Can&rsquo;t wait to see the &ldquo;refurbished&rdquo; Harry Potter Theme Park. I grew up reading Harry Potter series (countless nights in bed and thus shortsightedness). Finally get a chance to get myself a wand and drink butterbeer.</p>

<p>But, as always, you can&rsquo;t be happy and lucky all the time. Just turned down by Zillow for a Softwere Engineer Position. Well, I really like Seattle area and have a bunch of friends in there now. Too bad can&rsquo;t go there for on-site nor further career. A bit-manipulation interview question got me. I haven&rsquo;t use &amp; | ^ for years. Quite suprised that a well-known company actually will ask you this except the classic Two-Int-Exchange-Value question. Anyway, need to practice more on code.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yes, this is actually my first post.</p>

<p>I was never meant to be a guy who keeps track of eveything in his daily life. I thought the first impression others could/should have are &ldquo;wtf&rdquo; or &ldquo;who cares&rdquo;. Sadly, it didn&rsquo;t change until recently thanks to one of my friends.</p>

<p>So, I started this, and as a &ldquo;brogrammer&rdquo; I believe it&rsquo;s right of me to &ldquo;code&rdquo; my blog rather than write my blog.</p>

<p>For those who don&rsquo;t have enough knowledge in programming or whats-so-ever (lucky you), I use octopress, github and sublime text 2 to make all this blog stuff happens (Ya, I know you have no idea what I&rsquo;m talking about =D).</p>

<p>To make it short, I wanna keep track of my life so at least I can have some references to write autobiography when I&rsquo;m too old to code and/or I can pull up some cool stuff as evidence when talking bs to my kids/grandkids (Hope world peace until then).</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the whole point of this Journal/Blog/Diary stuff.</p>

<p>And, of cource, to practice English. Yes people, I know more than Java, Ruby, C++, Python and Javascript!</p>
