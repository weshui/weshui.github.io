    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yes, this is actually my first post.</p>

<p>I was never meant to be a guy who keeps track of eveything in his daily life. I thought the first impression others could/should have are &ldquo;wtf&rdquo; or &ldquo;who cares&rdquo;. Sadly, it didn&rsquo;t change until recently thanks to one of my friends.</p>

<p>So, I started this, and as a &ldquo;brogrammer&rdquo; I believe it&rsquo;s right of me to &ldquo;code&rdquo; my blog rather than write my blog.</p>

<p>For those who don&rsquo;t have enough knowledge in programming or whats-so-ever (lucky you), I use octopress, github and sublime text 2 to make all this blog stuff happens (Ya, I know you have no idea what I&rsquo;m talking about =D).</p>

<p>To make it short, I wanna keep track of my life so at least I can have some references to write autobiography when I&rsquo;m too old to code and/or I can pull up some cool stuff as evidence when talking bs to my kids/grandkids (Hope world peace until then).</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the whole point of this Journal/Blog/Diary stuff.</p>

<p>And, of cource, to practice English. Yes people, I know more than Java, Ruby, C++, Python and Javascript!</p>
