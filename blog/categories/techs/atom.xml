    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Its been a while not posting anything. Well, now I&rsquo;m back =D</p>

<p>This is pretty cool stuff.</p>

<p>Despite its fails(unwise decisions) in many other fields recent years(Win Phone, Xbox, some Nokia), Microsoft Research is still delivering astonishing good stuff. Check out this video. Its a awesome way to use augumented reality =D</p>

<p>Good job MSFT Research</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Spent hours watching Amazon event live today with CNET.</p>

<p>Gotta say Fire Phone&rsquo;s dynamic perceptive is pretty &ldquo;Amazing&rdquo; at first glance. Imaging you can show off that to your friends =D</p>

<p><div class="embed-video-container"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/iB75HJe8eiI" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></p>

<p>Very cool at first glance, right?</p>

<p>Except that, I don&rsquo;t quite see many &ldquo;Amazing&rdquo; things. Firefly? the app that can recognize everything? Well, apparently I don&rsquo;t want to buy everything from Amazon =D Joking around, the app is clearly to promote to Shop on Amazon, which I don&rsquo;t quite agree that most people will buy. Maybe its a whole new experience for Amazon-mania, but Amazon is not Apple.</p>

<p>Jump to it&rsquo;s price, 300 bucks for a contract phone just to showoff 3D Lock Screen? Let me think&hellip; Nope</p>

<p>Nice try Mr. Benzos. But I will switch to iPhone 6 most likely.</p>

<p>Keyboard-less typing!</p>

<p>I think they kinda have to train &ldquo;it&rdquo; (machine learning) so &ldquo;it&rdquo; can recongnize different gesture. Would make more sense if using Online Learning (since everyone has a different way to type, so the keyboard can adjust itself).</p>

<p>Imaging using this for your ipad. Would like to sign-up for beta =D</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Finished the recap for WWDC 2014 yesterday. Didn&rsquo;t get a chance to write some of my thoughts on it until today.</p>

<p>Every summer, Google-Apple-Microsoft, the big 3 will host a serise of conferences to &ldquo;show off&rdquo; their latest work. Microsoft don&rsquo;t really draw a lot attention and I personally don&rsquo;t like its product (despite the fact that I do have a Nokia phone, but it does not run very smoothly and I don&rsquo;t appreciate that). So, it&rsquo;s quite interesting to watch Apple WWDC vs. Google I/O each year.</p>

<p>Despite its length (more than 2 hrs), I can see 3 major points from WWDC.</p>

<pre><code>Mac OS X Yosemite
iOS 8
Swift (not Taylor)
</code></pre>

<p>The following are my thoughts on each:</p>

<p>Start with <strong>Yosemite</strong>. I&rsquo;m not quite &ldquo;amazed&rdquo; by this except probably its name. (Dan, never been to Yosemite before but will do in this year.) Updates include a lot &ldquo;easier to use&rdquo; features. I will love the features like Mark for email and the new notification ctr where you can put widgets. But still, these new updates do not quite catch my eye when I was watching the video. It&rsquo;s Apple with Tim but only these updates this year? Not stress on performance/batter-life/compability? Well, let&rsquo;s wait and see then.</p>

<p><strong>iOS 8</strong> don&rsquo;t have a lot things as well. Honestly, group-chatting/file-sharing/voice-messge have been out there for years (Yes, I&rsquo;m talking about <a href="http://www.wechat.com/en/">WeChat</a>/QQ, which dominate China). I guess next step for iOS is to have it&rsquo;s own version of moment(a social sharing function built-in WeChat) maybe? One good thing is the tunnel between iOS and Mac OS X is finally opened. I&rsquo;ve been expecting this for quite a while. The continuity is not a quite new stuff. Last time I heard about this concept is from Netflix, where you can pick-up where you left on video across different platforms. And, it should work well with the large amount of Mac/iOS devices out there. What&rsquo;s next? Continuity on apps? Wait, this actually could work. You are welcome Apple.</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>Swift/DevCenter</strong>. As a developer, I gotta say Apple you did a great job here. The ability to use different services from different apps could make our lifes so much easier (both developer and consumer). And the new kits for Graphic looks so cool. 3D kit for casual game? Thats a good idea. Not to mention the new Swift language. Even tho it might be a little bit offend (I know what I&rsquo;m coding, thank you, I don&rsquo;t need to see it, just go away Swift!), but it definitely will help in most of the circumanstances. Wow, this new SDK is quite amazing! Can&rsquo;t wait to start writing my apps, but ya, need to read that 500 pages Swift book first&hellip;=P</p>

<p>And, last but not least, no words for iPhone 6. Gosh, I&rsquo;m waiting for a year but not a single word. (Don&rsquo;t look at me like this, Nokia. Maybe we should just be friends)</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s see what Google I/O will bring =)</p>
