    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I met with my girlfriend Ivy when we were both students in University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. She was a master candidate majoring in Econ, and I was a 屌丝(Diaosi, Chinese Charactors, roughly translate into &ldquo;a nerdy guy who everyone knows will not get a girl friend&rdquo;) in Math &amp; Computer Science.</p>

<p>Oct 2 of 2014 is our 1st year anniversary, and right now we are on skype while I&rsquo;m typing this blog.</p>

<p>She must not know the following project details as this will be my suprise gift for her.</p>

<p>I will launch a website with customized domain name, hosted on github. In the website, I will do some cool stuff (TBD, but have some cool ideas) to impress her.</p>

<p>How likely she will find out about this intent? Hmm, statistically highly unlikely. She is just a normal girl who can&rsquo;t distinguish Mac OS &amp; iOS =P</p>

<p>Will post more updates later.</p>
