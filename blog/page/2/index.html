		<p>Booked our trip to Orlando the coming July 4th. Can&rsquo;t wait to see the &ldquo;refurbished&rdquo; Harry Potter Theme Park. I grew up reading Harry Potter series (countless nights in bed and thus shortsightedness). Finally get a chance to get myself a wand and drink butterbeer.</p>

<p>But, as always, you can&rsquo;t be happy and lucky all the time. Just turned down by Zillow for a Softwere Engineer Position. Well, I really like Seattle area and have a bunch of friends in there now. Too bad can&rsquo;t go there for on-site nor further career. A bit-manipulation interview question got me. I haven&rsquo;t use &amp; | ^ for years. Quite suprised that a well-known company actually will ask you this except the classic Two-Int-Exchange-Value question. Anyway, need to practice more on code.</p>

<p>Gotta say Fire Phone&rsquo;s dynamic perceptive is pretty &ldquo;Amazing&rdquo; at first glance. Imaging you can show off that to your friends =D</p>

<p>Very cool at first glance, right?</p>

<p>Except that, I don&rsquo;t quite see many &ldquo;Amazing&rdquo; things. Firefly? the app that can recognize everything? Well, apparently I don&rsquo;t want to buy everything from Amazon =D Joking around, the app is clearly to promote to Shop on Amazon, which I don&rsquo;t quite agree that most people will buy. Maybe its a whole new experience for Amazon-mania, but Amazon is not Apple.</p>

<p>Jump to it&rsquo;s price, 300 bucks for a contract phone just to showoff 3D Lock Screen? Let me think&hellip; Nope</p>

<p>Nice try Mr. Benzos. But I will switch to iPhone 6 most likely.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Github provides such a great hosting service free of charge, too bad that the domain name is default to be</p>

<pre><code>http://github_id.github.io
</code></pre>

<p>Indeed, we programmers tend to &ldquo;show off&rdquo; our knowledges in anthing-related-to-computer, so it&rsquo;s often the case that we use our own domain name instead. For easy memorization and, of course, the bragging right.</p>

<p>Here in this post, I will walk through the topic on how to set up your own domain name on Github. Main reason I want to do this is because I found the turtial online is kinda confusing. I will try to explain it in a plain english manner.</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t quite understand the concept, here is a good <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/48090?hl=en">link</a> that explains everything concept you need to know before get it stared.</p>

<blockquote><p>Step 1, get a domain name</p></blockquote>

<p>Yes, you have to buy one and all the domain names come with price. For example, this website&rsquo;s domain name is 10 dollors/year, not that bad if you think about it. You can buy domain name from <strong>domain name registrar</strong>, <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/">GoDaddy</a>, <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">namecheap</a> just to name a few. For consistency, let&rsquo;s say you register a domain name <strong>yourdomain.com</strong> on Namecheap. (Note, this tutorial is for APEX domain name. Subdomains should be able to follow most of the steps until but not include step 4)</p>

<blockquote><p>Step 2, host your website on Github</p></blockquote>

<p>For details on how to host your website on github, here is the <a href="https://pages.github.com/">link</a>. Create repository and push it. Simple enough. By now, you should have a repository called <em>github_id.github.io</em></p>

<blockquote><p>Step 3, push a file named CNAME into your respository</p></blockquote>

<p>Create a file in your <em>github_id.github.io</em> repository called <strong>CNAME</strong>. There should be only one line in this newly create file, that is <strong>youdomain.com</strong>. Push this file to Github and make sure it exists under root directory.</p>

<blockquote><p>Step 4, redirect your domain name to Github</p></blockquote>

<p>Go to your account where you registered your domain name, select your domain name and under the <strong>Host Management</strong> tab (or similar tab), click <strong>All Host Records</strong>. By default, top should have two records, one as <strong>@</strong> and one as <strong>www</strong>. Change them to :</p>

<pre><code>@       192.30.252.154    A(Address)    n/a    1800
www     yourdomain.com    URL Redirect  n/a    1800
</code></pre>

<p>In the sub-domain settings, we need to add another record(thanks to github) that redirect the host to Github server, it looks like</p>

<pre><code>@       192.30.252.153    A(Address)    n/a    1800 
</code></pre>

<p>Save this settings.</p>

<blockquote><p>Step 5, wait until it comes up</p></blockquote>

<p>Github can take time to configure these settings, so be patience. To test the host, we can use the methods described in the tutotial.</p>

<pre><code>dig yourdomain.com +nostats +nocomments +nocmd
</code></pre>

<p>if the IP addresses show up are precisely 192.30.252.154 and 192.30.252.153(if everything is normal, both should show up), we are good to go!</p>

<p>This is the tutorial for setting up APEX domain name on github, buf if you have a subdomain name, for example <strong>www.yourdomain.com</strong> instead of <strong>yourdomain.com</strong>, your don&rsquo;t need to create A record. Just redirect the www url to <strong>your_id.github.io</strong> should do the trick.</p>

<p>Here is the original link to the <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages">turotial</a> Github provides.</p>

		<p>Fortunately,  Ivy still seems unaware of what I&rsquo;ve been doing recently. Everytime she asked &ldquo;What are you doing for the night?&rdquo;, I answered &ldquo;Coding&rdquo;. I know she probably will never find this website until I tell her. Can&rsquo;t wait to see what she will response to this =P</p>

<p>I have several possible outlines for this project. But it seems an awesome website with customized video recap for the past year would be the most-likely one to literally make her burst into tears (Evil me). For the credit, I got this idea from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/lookback">Facebook Lookback</a>. I like your work Facebook, so please don&rsquo;t sue me.</p>

<p>In order to do that, I need many tools/programms:</p>

<pre><code>Photo Editing Software
Video Editing Software
Photo Mosaic (Plan to write one)
Photo Fetcher from Facebook (Plan to write one)
Bootstrap + Good JS libaray to make website neat(possibly Angular.js)
TBA
</code></pre>

<p>Cool stuff and a tons of learning experiences and potential opportunity to impress girl friend.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Finished the recap for WWDC 2014 yesterday. Didn&rsquo;t get a chance to write some of my thoughts on it until today.</p>

<p>Every summer, Google-Apple-Microsoft, the big 3 will host a serise of conferences to &ldquo;show off&rdquo; their latest work. Microsoft don&rsquo;t really draw a lot attention and I personally don&rsquo;t like its product (despite the fact that I do have a Nokia phone, but it does not run very smoothly and I don&rsquo;t appreciate that). So, it&rsquo;s quite interesting to watch Apple WWDC vs. Google I/O each year.</p>

<p>Despite its length (more than 2 hrs), I can see 3 major points from WWDC.</p>

<pre><code>Mac OS X Yosemite
iOS 8
Swift (not Taylor)
</code></pre>

<p>The following are my thoughts on each:</p>

<p>Start with <strong>Yosemite</strong>. I&rsquo;m not quite &ldquo;amazed&rdquo; by this except probably its name. (Dan, never been to Yosemite before but will do in this year.) Updates include a lot &ldquo;easier to use&rdquo; features. I will love the features like Mark for email and the new notification ctr where you can put widgets. But still, these new updates do not quite catch my eye when I was watching the video. It&rsquo;s Apple with Tim but only these updates this year? Not stress on performance/batter-life/compability? Well, let&rsquo;s wait and see then.</p>

<p><strong>iOS 8</strong> don&rsquo;t have a lot things as well. Honestly, group-chatting/file-sharing/voice-messge have been out there for years (Yes, I&rsquo;m talking about <a href="http://www.wechat.com/en/">WeChat</a>/QQ, which dominate China). I guess next step for iOS is to have it&rsquo;s own version of moment(a social sharing function built-in WeChat) maybe? One good thing is the tunnel between iOS and Mac OS X is finally opened. I&rsquo;ve been expecting this for quite a while. The continuity is not a quite new stuff. Last time I heard about this concept is from Netflix, where you can pick-up where you left on video across different platforms. And, it should work well with the large amount of Mac/iOS devices out there. What&rsquo;s next? Continuity on apps? Wait, this actually could work. You are welcome Apple.</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>Swift/DevCenter</strong>. As a developer, I gotta say Apple you did a great job here. The ability to use different services from different apps could make our lifes so much easier (both developer and consumer). And the new kits for Graphic looks so cool. 3D kit for casual game? Thats a good idea. Not to mention the new Swift language. Even tho it might be a little bit offend (I know what I&rsquo;m coding, thank you, I don&rsquo;t need to see it, just go away Swift!), but it definitely will help in most of the circumanstances. Wow, this new SDK is quite amazing! Can&rsquo;t wait to start writing my apps, but ya, need to read that 500 pages Swift book first&hellip;=P</p>

<p>And, last but not least, no words for iPhone 6. Gosh, I&rsquo;m waiting for a year but not a single word. (Don&rsquo;t look at me like this, Nokia. Maybe we should just be friends)</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s see what Google I/O will bring =)</p>

		<p>I met with my girlfriend Ivy when we were both students in University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. She was a master candidate majoring in Econ, and I was a 屌丝(Diaosi, Chinese Charactors, roughly translate into &ldquo;a nerdy guy who everyone knows will not get a girl friend&rdquo;) in Math &amp; Computer Science.</p>

<p>Oct 2 of 2014 is our 1st year anniversary, and right now we are on skype while I&rsquo;m typing this blog.</p>

<p>She must not know the following project details as this will be my suprise gift for her.</p>

<p>I will launch a website with customized domain name, hosted on github. In the website, I will do some cool stuff (TBD, but have some cool ideas) to impress her. The website will be on <a href="http://wes-ivy.me">http://wes-ivy.me</a> , which currently redirects to this blog.</p>

<p>How likely she will find out about this intent? Hmm, statistically highly unlikely. She is just a normal girl who can&rsquo;t distinguish Mac OS &amp; iOS =P</p>

<p>This project will be a whole learning experience for me as well. I&rsquo;ve done Bootstrap before, but to really do what I have in mind requires far more than playing around.</p>

<p>I have 4 months, lets go and see.</p>

<p>Will post more updates later.</p>

		<p>Yes, this is actually my first post.</p>

<p>I was never meant to be a guy who keeps track of eveything in his daily life. I thought the first impression others could/should have are &ldquo;wtf&rdquo; or &ldquo;who cares&rdquo;. Sadly, it didn&rsquo;t change until recently thanks to one of my friends.</p>

<p>So, I started this, and as a &ldquo;brogrammer&rdquo; I believe it&rsquo;s right of me to &ldquo;code&rdquo; my blog rather than write my blog.</p>

<p>For those who don&rsquo;t have enough knowledge in programming or whats-so-ever (lucky you), I use octopress, github and sublime text 2 to make all this blog stuff happens (Ya, I know you have no idea what I&rsquo;m talking about =D).</p>

<p>To make it short, I wanna keep track of my life so at least I can have some references to write autobiography when I&rsquo;m too old to code and/or I can pull up some cool stuff as evidence when talking bs to my kids/grandkids (Hope world peace until then).</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the whole point of this Journal/Blog/Diary stuff.</p>

<p>And, of cource, to practice English. Yes people, I know more than Java, Ruby, C++, Python and Javascript!</p>
